Ashwani Gujral of ashwanigujral.com told CNBC-TV18, "Axis Bank is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 508, target of Rs 530. Real estate has also come back, so HDIL is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 86, target of Rs 98."



	
	Shares of housing finance companies (HFCs) have rallied up to 8% on the BSE in otherwise range-bound market on the back of heavy volumes.

	LIC Housing Finance, Indiabulls Housing Finance and Can Fin Homes hit their respective record highs on the BSE in intra-day on Tuesday.

	According to analysts at Motilal Oswal Securities, the mortgage markets are in hyper competitive mode which is leading to moderation in retail loan segment. Despite this, with softening interest rates and improving home affordability, this segment is expected to grow at 15% CAGR (compound annual growth rate) over the medium term.

	Can Fin Homes, the largest gainer among HFCs pack, was up 8% to Rs 2,830 on BSE. LIC Housing Finance has rallied 6.6% to Rs 712 on BSE in intra-day trade.

	While LIC Housing Finance has been growing at a decent pace of 15% YoY, much of the incremental growth is now coming from non-core business (loan against property or LAP and builder financing). Analysts believe growth in these segments is necessary to sustain spreads.

	Indiabulls Housing Finance too up 5% to Rs 1,017 on BSE. Analyst at CLSA believe Indiabulls Housing Finance will be a key beneficiary of the rise in demand for mortgages as it leverages an improved funding profile, network expansion and lower market share.

	Meanwhile, Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO’s) initial public offering (IPO) will hit the markets on May 8.

	HUDCO is a wholly-owned Government company with more than 46 years of experience in providing loans for housing and urban infrastructure projects in India. The government will dilute 10.13% (204 million shares) stake in the housing and urban infrastructure financer in the IPO as a part of its 2017-18 disinvestment programme. The price band for the IPO has been set at Rs 56-Rs 60 per share. Retail investors and employees are being offered a discount of Rs 2 per share on the issue price.

"I have a second buy call on Union Bank futures. Again this stock has similar pattern of OBC Bank. It looks very positive for me and even from current level, it can head upwards. Look at initial target of Rs 188, have a stop loss of Rs 177 on this long call," he said.
Indiabulls Housing Finance posted good numbers, showing strong business growth in Q4; the bottomline though is aided by one-off tax provision.In an interview to CNBC-TV18, Ashwini Kumar Hooda, Deputy MD of Indiabulls Housing Finance spoke about the results and his outlook for the company.Speaking about capitalisation and profitability he said, "We are generating good profitability. Our sense is we will not need any capital from the market for the next three years or so".

Below is the verbatim transcript of the interview.Sonia: Can you tell us what have been the disbursement and the assets under management (AUM) growth in this quarter and more importantly what is sustainable?A: The growth has been coming largely from the home loan sector which continues to show strong momentum especially in the entry level affordable houses. So we are big beneficiary of large transactions in affordable housing space and hence for the year we have disbursed Rs 33,500 crore of loan which has resulted in loan book growth of 33 percent to Rs 91,000 crore plus of the book. Most of the growth has come from home loan, so now home loans which were 52 percent at the start of the year, have grown to be 56 percent of the loan book. Loan against property now constitute 22 percent and corporate loan also are 22 percent.Latha: Give us your guidance on loan growth, disbursement and which segment will aid in loan growth. Will it be retail, will it be loan against property or will it be corporate which you said grew at 22 percent?A: The growth will largely come from the home loan. We have guided the market that home loan, which is 56 percent of our book will grow to 66 percent of our book in next 24 months while loan against property will grow at 18-20 percent and corporate loan will grow at 12-16 percent, home loan should grow for us between 35 percent and 45 percent and business as a whole should continue to grow in excess of 25 percent over next three years.Anuj: How do you see margins going ahead from here?A: The spreads have remained stable around 320 bps for many years now. We have guided market that our spreads will remain between 300 and 325 bps, so we continue to operate on the higher side of the margin expectation. We have been beneficiary of huge drop in marginal cost of lending rate (MCLR) by banks, as almost 39 percent of our liability which is term loans and 11 percent of our sold down securitised home loan pool are linked to bank's MCLR and we have had unique savings on these floating rate loans.Sonia: The gross non-performing asset (NPA) has increased by about 12 percent compared to last quarter. Did you use any Reserve Bank of India (RBI) forbearance?A: We have never used any kind of forbearance on any asset quality related issue. We are very conservative and we keep providing extra provisions for future unseen NPAs. As we speak gross NPA of the company is Rs 770 crore against which we are holding provisions of Rs 1,148 crore that is 148 percent of my gross NPAs. So we continue to be conservative, NPAs will come as book will grow, a certain percentage of NPAs will come but being a mortgage lender where the house is behind these NPAs, we are able to recover our entire money over a period of time.Latha: What is the guidance on asset quality?A: We had communicated to our stakeholders six years back that gross NPAs will be contained between 70 bps and 90 bps and net NPAs will be 30 bps to 50 bps. It has been 28 quarters now that we have been within these ranges.Anuj: How long will the current capital suffice for growth?A: We are generating good profitability; there is a good return on equity and the capital adequacy continues to be very high at 20.9 percent, tier one is 17.25 percent but regulatory requirement is only 6 percent. These are very high capitalisation level. My leverage adjusted for cash on balance sheet is only 5.7 times. So I am the least levered housing finance company. Therefore, our sense is we will not need any capital from the market for next three years or so and would probably visit the market in 2021. We should be able to maintain our total capital adequacy around 18 percent and tier one of 13.5 percent till then.
CA Rudramurthy BV, Research Head at Vachana Investments told CNBC-TV18, "I am very bullish on real estate as a sector, PSU banks, housing finance companies, and even NBFCs. Now keeping these sectors in mind, I have picked up two banks."
Some traders say it is possible for a cartel of brokers to get together and take up huge positions through circular trading in a way that the marketwide limit in a security is breached. That makes it impossible for new traders to sell the futures even if they feel the rise in a company’s stock price is unjustified. This helps keep the stock price firm. Also, traders with existing short positions in the derivatives segment will be forced to cover their positions at a higher price, pushing the stock price even higher.

CA Rudramurthy BV, Research Head at Vachana Investments told CNBC-TV18, "I am very bullish on real estate as a sector, PSU banks, housing finance companies, and even NBFCs. Now keeping these sectors in mind, I have picked up two banks.""Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) looks very positive. In last two days, too much of delivery based addition has been seen with prices moving on the upside. Today even I have seen a lot of open interest addition in the current month futures position. So, OBC has given a fresh breakout today above levels of Rs 175. Rounding bottom formation is seen and stock can head towards levels of Rs 185 initially. Have a stop loss of Rs 173 for this long call.""I have a second buy call on Union Bank futures. Again this stock has similar pattern of OBC Bank. It looks very positive for me and even from current level, it can head upwards. Look at initial target of Rs 188, have a stop loss of Rs 177 on this long call," he said.

"I have a last buy call on Indiabulls Housing Finance. This stock again has given a clear breakout above levels of Rs 880 and now is in a clear uptrend. Short-term, medium-term, long-term timeframe, everything looks very positive. A lot of open interest addition is also seen in this counter. Look at initial target of Rs 1,150 on Indiabulls Housing Finance, have a stop loss of Rs 1,070 for this long call," he added.
Ashwani Gujral of ashwanigujral.com told CNBC-TV18, "Axis Bank is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 508, target of Rs 530. Real estate has also come back, so HDIL is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 86, target of Rs 98.""Indiabulls Housing Finance is a buy with a stop loss of Rs 1,100, target of Rs 1,220," he said.
"Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone has already broken out of nice attractive bullish pattern. It is a buying opportunity."
Sudarshan Sukhani of s2analytics.com told CNBC-TV18, "Axis Bank and ICICI Bank are giving attractive bullish patterns. Up and down move days will keep on happening but for today Axis Bank is worth buying into. It has a bad day on Friday, so we are buying at the lows.""Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone has already broken out of nice attractive bullish pattern. It is a buying opportunity.""Hindustan Petroleum Corporation (HPCL) had a bad day but broadly Bharat Petroleum Corporation (BPCL) and HPCL are showing sustained upmove. So we are buying on a dip," he said.

"The CNX IT chart has been consolidating for the last one month while we think that the sector has gone to the dogs. It may not be so. The market is fairly sanguine that this could be a short-term low. Infosys is on the verge of breaking on the upside, so that is a buying opportunity.""My sole short sell is Jindal Steel & Power which has made a bearish pattern; it is going down and looking at lower levels," he added.
Now the good news is that all the above mentioned business practices have a great sell in the US, and customers are willing to pay for new age IT services if they add value to the business. And since the talent for services such as AI and machine learning is readily available in the US, training engineers locally is not going to be that difficult.
